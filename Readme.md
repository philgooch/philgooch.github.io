# Chilcot Inquiry: HTML source

The aim of this project is to provide an easily navigable, searchable and interactive
HTML version of The Report of the Iraq Inquiry by Sir John Chilcot, which
was [published only in PDF form](http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/the-report/).

This Gist details how the PDF was converted to HTML:

and the `add_links.xsl` was used to generate the table of contents
and link the footnote references to the footnotes.

There was also a bit of manual cleanup :)

## TODO
- Proper search
- Add glossary links
- Add Wikipedia links for background reading
- Extract entities and relations into a semantic network
